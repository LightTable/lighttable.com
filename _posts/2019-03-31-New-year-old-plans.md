The last time a major release of Light Table was in early 2016. It's been 3 years.
3 years is **a lot** in developers time. Since, Light Table's last release,
[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has developed from `0.10.6` to `1.32.0`.
Amazing development too happened in La La Clojure Land, Clojure evolved from
version `1.8.0` to `1.10.1-beta` while ClojureScript developed from `1.7.228` to
`1.10.516`. I don't want to start on mentioning the advances on La La JS land,
because it's too much. It's even been 2 years to last

by Scott Bauer in which Scott had awesome plans to continue development of
Light Table.
