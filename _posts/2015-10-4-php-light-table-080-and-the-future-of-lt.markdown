It's been almost a year since the last significant release of Light Table but [we're finally nearing completion of the release of version 0.8.0 (alpha)](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/issues/1936).

The major change is the migration from [node-webkit](http://nwjs.io/) (now NW.js) to [Atom Shell](http://electron.atom.io/) (now Electron).

TODO: Write about other changes

### The Future of Light Table

The original core team at Kodowa has moved on to [another project](http://www.witheve.com/).

TODO: Write something about the new core team

TODO: Write something about what users can expect for ongoing development, i.e. contributions will consist of what contributors are willing to work on
